# This is a long method, using variables can shorten this process. See below.
print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

name = input("What is your name? \n")
length = len(name) # This is creating a variable named 'length' finding the length of name.
print(length)

# Always make your code readable, variables should be easily identifiable.
